# Lab 1 - Plan a Client Summit with Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

Imagine you're a business operations associate at a mid-sized consulting firm. Your manager has asked you to lead planning for an upcoming Client Innovation Summit. You’ll use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to gather insights, generate ideas, visualize the schedule, draft a planning document, summarize it, and collaborate with your colleagues. 

The tasks in this lab will guide you on how to navigate and prompt in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. To fully complete this lab, you need a Microsoft 365 subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> These tasks are designed specifically for use with **web mode** in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. If you have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license, make sure you **manually switch to web mode** when you open Copilot Chat, as it may default to work mode. Using **web mode** ensures the prompts behave as intended and source information from public web content.

## Task 1: Summarize industry trends for event planning

1. In the same chat with Copilot, enter this prompt:

   Create an agenda timeline for a 1-day summit focused on [trend] with an introduction, closing, sessions at 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 1:30 PM, and 3:00 PM, two mini breaks, and an hour break for lunch in a table format.

## Task 4: Draft a planning document for the summit

Now that you’ve outlined the structure and ideas for your event, use Copilot Chat to create a planning brief to put into a word document. This document will serve as your anchor for the project, capturing goals, session details, and success metrics in one place.

1. At the **Enter password** screen, enter Password1 (provided by your tenant provider), then select **Sign in**..
   
1. If prompted to **Stay signed in?**, select the **Don't show this again** checkbox, then select **Yes**.

1. Select **Blank document** to open a new Word document.

1. **Paste** the Copilot response you copied into the Word document.

1. Select **File** at the top right corner of your document, then select **Save As** to save your document.

1. Under Other Locations select **This PC**, then enter a **file name** in the textbox at the top to give your document a name (ex: Client Summit Planning Brief).

1.  Select **Save**, then **close** out of your document.

1. Navigate back to your Copilot Chat conversation to complete task 5.

## Task 5: Analyze and generate content from a file

1. Continue in Copilot Chat, enter this prompt and upload the file you created in Task 4: 

    Summarize the key points from this planning brief into only 5 condensed bullet points:

## Task 6: Collaborate using Copilot Pages

Turn the email draft from Task 5 into a collaborative workspace using Copilot Pages. This will let you simulate how multiple team members can refine content in real time.

1. Select **Edit in Pages** underneath Copilot’s last response in **Task 5** (or any response you prefer) to copy over that information to Copilot Pages.

1. A new Copilot Page will open on the right pane of Copilot Chat, explore the following actions:

    - Give the page a new title at the top of the page.  
    - Type any additional content throughout the page by just clicking into the page.
    - Add an additional Copilot Chat response (previous or new) to the page by selecting **Add to page** at the bottom of the response. 
    - Enter **"/"** to insert content blocks, such as a table, or checklist.
    - **@mention** a colleague (or simulate this) and grant them access by selecting **Share and notify** in the message that pops up when adding their name.
    - Optionally, share your page by selecting the **Share** icon at the top right of the page and selecting one of the two options to copy a link.
